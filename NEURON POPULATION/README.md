# Neuron Population with Izhikevich Model
---
In this project, we analyze neuron populations using the Izhikevich neuron model. The Izhikevich model is known for reproducing spiking and bursting behavior observed in cortical neurons. We analyzed behavior of neurons in some types of connections. You can see the results in `report2.pdf`. We summarized the findings from various connection types, emphasizing the role of network architecture and neuron parameters in shaping population activity.

## 2. Types of Connections

### 2.1. INH to EXC

In this connection type, inhibitory neurons reduce the current of post-synaptic excitatory neurons when they spike. 

### 2.2. EXC to INH

In this connection, excitatory neurons increase the current of post-synaptic inhibitory neurons when they spike. We explored the effects of varying parameters and currents.

### 2.3. Other Connection Types

We explored additional connection types, including INH to EXC, EXC to INH, and EXC to EXC connections, by modifying parameters and analyzing resulting neuron activities.

### 2.4. Bi-directional connections and INH to INH

We examined networks with bi-directional connections and INH to INH connections, considering how these configurations affect neuron behavior.

### 2.5. Bi-directional connections and EXC to EXC

We analyzed networks with bi-directional connections and EXC to EXC connections, studying the interplay between excitatory neurons and the impact of these connections on activity.
