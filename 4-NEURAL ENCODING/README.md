# Neural Encoding

## Introduction

The "Neural Encoding" project explores various hypotheses of information representation in the brain, known as neural codes, which play a crucial role in the functioning of spiking neural networks (SNNs). Neural codes are essential for understanding how the brain transmits and processes information between neurons. The report discusses the debate between rate coding and temporal coding in the neuroscience community, highlighting the importance of both approaches in information encoding.

## Two Encoding Methods Explored

### 1. Time-To-First-Spike (TTFS) Encoding

TTFS encoding is a neural code that emphasizes the precise timing of the first spike after a stimulus is presented. This code is particularly useful for conveying information rapidly. The report presents several examples of TTFS encoding applied to images from the MNIST dataset. The intensity of each pixel in the image is mapped to the timing of spikes in neurons, providing a unique way to represent visual stimuli.

### 2. Position Encoding

Position encoding involves neurons with Gaussian tuning curves, where neurons respond most strongly to stimuli near their mean. This encoding method is used for representing continuous variables like joint positions, eye positions, colors, or sound frequencies. The report illustrates position encoding with examples, showing how neurons' responses are related to the position of the stimulus in a Gaussian-like fashion.
