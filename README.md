# Computational Neuroscience Projects

This project simulate and analyze Izhikevich and LIF neuron model, neural populations, neural encoding, convolution and pooling layers, filters like Gabor and DoG, STDP learning rule, reinforcement STDP learning rule.

---

We used [PymoNNtorch](https://github.com/cnrl/PymoNNtorch/tree/main>) framework for this project.
------------

The sources for PymoNNtorch can be downloaded from the [Github repo](https://github.com/cnrl/pymonntorch).

You can either clone the public repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/cnrl/pymonntorch

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

    $ python setup.py install

There are a jupyter notebook and a report pdf in each folder. In the report files you can see the results and analysis. The projects are:

## IZHIKEVICH NEURON ANALYSIS

Python implementation and analysis of the Izhikevich neuron model and analyze the behavior of this model.

## NEURON POPULATION

In this project, we analyze neuron populations using the Izhikevich neuron model.

## NEURON POPULATION(new connections)

The project focuses on simulating neuron populations using the Izhikevich neuron model and analyzing their behavior and activities with new connections compared to the last project.

## NEURAL ENCODING

The Neural Encoding project explores various hypotheses of information representation in the brain, known as neural codes, which play a crucial role in the functioning of spiking neural networks (SNNs).

## LEARNING RULES(stdp and rstdp)

This project delves into the world of neural learning, specifically focusing on two learning rules: FlatSTDP and FlatRSTDP

## DOG and GABOR FILTER

The project explains the visual cortex, the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information using Gabor and DoG filters.

## CONVOLUTION and POOLING CONNECTION

This project provides a detailed exploration of convolution and pooling connections in the context of Computational Neuroscience.
