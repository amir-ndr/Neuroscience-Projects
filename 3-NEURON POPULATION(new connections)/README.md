# Neuron Population with Izhikevich Model

The project focuses on simulating neuron populations using the Izhikevich neuron model and analyzing their behavior and activities.

## Simulation
The project involves creating two excitatory populations and one inhibitory population, each consisting of homogeneous neurons with the same parameters. The size of the excitatory populations is 400, and the inhibitory population size is 100. Random currents from a normal distribution are injected into these populations for 300 iterations. Please note that there is randomness in the currents.

## Connections and Parameters
Different types of connections and parameters are explored to analyze the behavior of the neuron populations. The current of the second excitatory population is intentionally made stronger than the first one in each simulation.
The code for these simulations, along with detailed explanations and visualizations, can be found in the project files.
